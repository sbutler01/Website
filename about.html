          <p> My name is Sunil Butler. I'll start from the basics. I entered college with intent to minor in English literature and with no expectation regarding my major. Halfway through college, I declared a math major and finished it in two years despite having been put on the humanities track. I then applied to and attended graduate school for statistics despite only having taken one formal statistics course. Rather than developing one skill and continuing to practice it, I've spent my life developing and refining my ability to learn new things and to solve a variety of problems from different angles. I'm always looking for the next new challenge, and I'm always ready to dive in headfirst.
