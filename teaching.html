          <h1>Passing Down My Knowledge</h1>
          <p> I taught statistics throughout my time in graduate school. For most of my time, I ran the online section of a class called Stat 301. The class was required for science majors and covered the basics of statistical methods and theory. My duties included setting a calendar for the recorded lectures, handling all student complaints and questions and most importantly, answering student questions on the discussion board regarding the class material.

          <p> I was chosen for this assignnment specifically because of my minor in English literature and other evidence of my writing proficiency. Teaching statistics in-person is not particularly easy, but conveying the same concepts when there is not possibility of conversation and interaction presented a significant challenge. I spent a lot of time teaching my students to ask questions in specific and informative way so I could pinpoint their exact area of misunderstanding and offer concise but effective advice. I also used rereading techniques to make sure there was no assumption of prior knowledge in my own answers arising from my experience with the subject.
          </p>
          <p> Additionally, I spent two semesters running in-person labs where I would walk students through assigned problems that were mote difficult than the homework. In these classes I taught business and humanities majors who were often less familiar and comfortable with math, but the ability to converse and interact with student nonetheless made this substantially easier then my online assignment. Students attending my recitations consistently scored in the top three on exams among all lab sections.
