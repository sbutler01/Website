          <h1>Is This Section Technically Recursive?</h1>
          <p> Either way, I'm proud of it! I wrote the basic script for this website by myself after reading several online sources on basics in HTML. I then got help from an excellent online tutorial by Udemy for many of the effects and aesthetic qualities. The biggest challenge I faced was properly utilizing css, as I was completely unfamiliar with it going into the project. I am most proud of getting transparent text to appear over a background picture in the section titles.

          <p> It's possible to return to the home screen without clicking 'HOME' or the 'back' arrow. See if you can figure out how.
