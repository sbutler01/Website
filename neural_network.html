          <h1>Story of my Neural Network</h1>
          <p>The primary task required to complete my masters thesis was to build a neural network in R using the Anaconda environment. I was to create a type of feed-forward neural network (diagrammed on the left) based on the one constructed by <a href="papers/Barunik_Paper.pdf">Barunik and Malinska</a> to predict crude oil futures prices. In their paper, Barunik and Malinska demonstrate that their model, which fits a Nelson-Siegel curve to prices based on maturity and then uses a neural network to predict the model's parameters, consistently outperforms common time series models when tested against validation data.
          </p>
          <p>My advisor's idea was to construct a similar model fitting basis splines to the maturities curves instead of the Nelson-Siegel model. I constructed a neural network from scratch based on some source code in Matlab and various descriptions online. After it was finished, I experimented with different constructions of both the neural network and the b-spline until I'd finally created something that consistently outperformed many other published neural networks.

          <p>Crude oil futures prices are an interesting challenge as their prices change both with their purchase date and their maturity, meaning that the price acts as a time series in two different dimensions (shown on the left). This project was made additionally difficult by the 'black box' nature of a neural network. Essentially, a model constructed by a neural network is built using the computer's own internal logic rather than a cohesive logical structure assigned by a human, so performing diagnostics on the model if it doesn't work well is difficult. The best approach is to have an in-depth knowledge of the nature of the data you're attempting to model and the optimization method of the neural network, as this will allow for educated guesses and experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>My model in most cases successfully outperformed the original model and several other models we tested against. There were some cases where my model failed to outperform the original model, but I was able to figure out exactly why this happened and to create a system that in almost every case correctly predicted whether my model or the original model would be more effective.
