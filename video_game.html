          <h1> My Chilhood Dream Job (is a lot of work)</h1>
          <p>Fortunately, it's a lot of very fun work. I've created two video games in python using the pygame package. My first foray into game development was a basic top-down  (shown on the left), for which I got a lot of help from an online tutorial. However, I added extensive modifications of my own design including power ups and the ability to shoot enemies.
          </p>
          <p> I made one particularly unique addition to this game, which was in my formulation of collision detection. The two options presented to me online were to either draw a box around every object or do pixel-bypixel collision, both of which were flawed for this game. Instead, I used polar coordinates taking into account the shape of each object to determine when a collision must have occurred. Code for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbutler01/Game_Python">here</a>.

          <h1> Now Onto the Really Cool Stuff</h1>
          <p> My second project was far more involved. I created a platformer with mutliple environments and enemy types, moving platforms and variables physical properties. I looked up several tips and sample code to get started, but the game engine as well as all facets of each level are entirely mine. The music and images were acquired (legally) from online sources.
          <p> What I'm most proud of is the cat/protagonist. He has walking, jumping, falling and scrambling animations. He reaches out to grab and scrambles up platforms and knows whether to pull himself up or forward. He expereiences gravity, friction and other physics elements. I'm also proud of the enemies on the second level, as getting them to stay 'dormant' until they sense you nearby and then to activate constituted a substantial programming challenge. Code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbutler01/Game_Python_2">here</a>.
