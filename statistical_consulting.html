          <h1>High-Yield Cereal Crops are Cooler Than You Think</h1>
          <p>I started my statistical consulting career with small services such as checking a t-test for accuracy or helping a researcher use statistical software. I quickly moved on to a large research project being worked on by several collaborating agricultural departments on growth conditions of Sorghum, a useful high-yield cereal crop. I worked with two other statistical consultants. Our job was to provide new and interesting methods for our collaborators to analyze their data, particularly measurements of the metabolite content of randomly chosen crops at the beginning, middle and end of the growing season.
          </p>
          <p>At our researchers' request, our analysis narrowed in on the change in each metabolite over the growing season. My idea was to classify all 9 possible changes over time (shown left) and sort the data by those changes; for example, metabolite measurements that increase over the first period and decreased over the second period were known as 'tent-shaped'. Defining this rigorously presented an interesting statistical challenge: how do you determine that something is statistically significantly 'tent-shaped'? We created two methods, one analytical and one computational. The analytical method classified the shapes based on statistical theory applying a modified t-test to determine whether change at each point in time was significant.

          <p>The computational method used a clustering algorithm to divide up the methobolite shapes by the genotype of the plant. Some sample results are shown to the left. We created sample charts, summary statistics, and a spreadsheet for raw data for use by our collaborators.
